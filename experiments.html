      <h3><a href="posts/lewitt/lewitt_complete_graph_color.html">Sol LeWitt's Drawing #118 (Color)</a></h3>
      <p>Further exploration Sol LeWitt's iconic art.</p>
      
      <h3><a href="posts/lewitt/lewitt_complete_graph_bw.html">Sol LeWitt's Algorithmic Drawing</a></h3>
      <p>Exploring and drawing inspiration from Sol LeWitt's conceptions of process, simplicity, impermanence, and (re)creation.</p>

      <h3><a href="posts/path_gen/path_gen_4.html">My Generation</a></h3>
      <p>As I experiment my way into this idiom of generative art I'm feeling that my choice making in code is more like what one might do when standing before a lump of clay, or a blank sheet of paper, or a easel and tubes of paint. The questions become ones about what is possible.</p>

      <h3><a href="posts/path_lab/path_lab_1.html">Path Lab #1</a></h3>
      <p>This image is not really generative. No algorithm is used in its creation. But chance, mistakes, and happy discoveries are, in fact, an important part of generative art. That's where I think a lot of the fun comes from.</p>

        <h4>Grid Series</h4>
        <p>For some reason I'm drawn toward working with grids of squares. Actually, there are probably very many reasons. I could keep busy just trying to exhaust them all.</p>

        <h3><a href="posts/kleesque/grid_mod_1.html">Grid Modern</a></h3>
        <p>Inspired by Piet Mondrian, but loosened up by Paul Klee.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="posts/grid_fan/grid_fan_1.html">Effulgence (Grid Fan #1)</a></h3>
        <p>Inspired by George Nees, a pioneer of computer-based generative art, this piece represents a welcome affirmation of my exploratory process so far.</p>

        <h3><a href="posts/nees/nees_squares_1.html">Georg Nees Study</a></h3>
        <p>George Nees was a pioneer of computer-based generative art, first exibiting his work in 1965. As part of my ongoing interest in grid-based motifs, I was drawn immediately upon discovery to one of Nees's lithographic prints found widely on the web.</p>

        <h3><a href="posts/neighborhood/neighborhood.html">Welcome to the Neighborhood</a></h3>
        <p>The Von Neumann neighborhood functions at the heart of the algorithm used in my visualization for Axelrod’s model of The Disemination of Culture. And it’s also central to the working of my implementation of the classic plastic toy, the Sliding Number Puzzle.</p>

        <h3><a href="gsap_labs/gsap-timeline-squares_1/rotate_squares_gsap_uo.html">Rotation of Squares (GreenSock)</a></h3>
        <p>Here I'm using the GreenSock animation framework to achieve staggering transformations.</p>

        <h3><a href="posts/rotate_squares/rotate_squares_cascad.html">Rotation of Squares (Cascading)</a></h3>
        <p>Here, with the click of a button we can achieve a cascading effect in which each square rotates in a delayed sequence.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="posts/rotate_squares/rotate_squares_simult.html">Rotation of Squares (Simultaneous)</a></h3>
        <p>Here we can rotate squares individually by clicking on them, or click a button to rotate all squares in a grid.</p>
        
        <h3 id="rot_sqr_1"><a href="posts/rotate_squares/rotate_squares.html">Rotation of Squares (Individual)</a></h3>
        <p>There are several artists<a class="href-decor" href="#fn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> whose work I want to explore and play with. In order to do that I need to be able to rotate and move squares around. Starting simple.</p>
