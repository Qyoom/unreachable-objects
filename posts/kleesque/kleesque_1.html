      <h2>Grid Modern</h2>
      <p>My infatuation with the grid continues. This time I was inspired to explore impressions whispered by Mondrion and Klee. These whispers quickly drifted away and I was subsumed in the technical task of manageing code, seeing where it would take me as I talked with it.</p>
      <p>Code is the medium. But I like to thing that the resulting artwork is the application which continues generating variations on sets of parameters. In the reductionsist sense, I am trying to explore space, color, movement, gesture through the expansion of the grid through the introduction of random arrangement, that is, playing with the strictures of the two dimensional plane.</p>
      <p>To give an idea of what generative art means for me, I had the thought this morning that these art pieces will continu forming and becoming and revealing themselves as long as they are hosted on a computer somewhere. They present versions of infinity. In that sense they are pieces of infinite artwork.</p>
      <p>If that sounds a little pompous, I appoloze. It actually feels humbling to me. After all, the grid, and the programing language, and the computers are just media and concepts that I am borrowing and playing with for a brief window of time.</p>
