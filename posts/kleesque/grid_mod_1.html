      <h2>Grid Modern</h2>
      <p>My infatuation with the grid continues. This time I was inspired to explore impressions whispered by <a class="href-decor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mondrian</a> and <a class="href-decor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Klee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klee</a>. These subliminal hints drifted away as I became subsumed in writing code, seeing where it would take me as I experimented and watched results.</p>
      <p>Code is the medium. It has its own logic and structure that, if I follow patiently, guides me toward what I think I am after, as well as interesting surprises. I like to think that the resulting application will continue generating unique variations as long as anyone cares to click the activate button.</p>
      <p>In the reductionist sense, I am trying to explore space, color, movement, and gesture through  expansion of the grid idea by introducing random arrangement of elements, and playing with the constraints of the two dimensional plane.</p>
      <p>To give an idea of what generative art means for me, I had the thought this morning that these pieces will continue forming and revealing new and original compositions as long as they are hosted on a computer somewhere, and someone finds them and presses the active button. In that sense they are representations of infinity.</p>
      <p>If that sounds a little pompous, I apologize. It actually feels humbling to me. After all, the grid, the programing language, and the computers are just media and concepts that I am borrowing and playing with for a brief window of time.</p>
