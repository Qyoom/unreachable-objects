      <h2>Path Lab 1</h2>
      <p>This image is not really generative. No algorithm is used in its creation. All decisions were made purposefully. Ah, well, some choices were random-ish in nature, such as the location of points, but they were made were made by a human (me), not a computer. However, the gist of the image stemmed from a happy discovery, a result that was initially unintended. Normally, you could say, a line has a color and a thickness (i.e. a stroke). But if a line doesn't form a closed shape (i.e. a circle, square, octagon, etc.) then it doesn't normally have an "inside" that could be filled with a color.</p>
      <p>In this case I had wanted to experiment with just a complex line (often referred to as a path). But when I created it the code I used defaulted to filling the resulting shape, irregular as it was, with a color, in this case black. I immediately liked the dynamic quality of the resulting shapes. To me it sort of has the feel of 1940's album cover art. So I continued playing with the path and the resulting irregular complex shape.</p>
      <p>Chance, mistakes, and happy discoveries, in fact, are an important part of generative art. Or probably all art to various degree. That's where I think a lot of the fun comes from.</p>
