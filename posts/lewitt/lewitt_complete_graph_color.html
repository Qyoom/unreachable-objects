      <h2>Sol LeWitt’s Wall Drawing #118 (Color)</h2>
      <p>
        This is a color version of my previous <a class="href-decor" href="./lewitt_complete_graph_bw.html">black and white study of Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawing #118</a>.
        See that version for my comments on LeWitt’s conceptual and minimalist process. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        My attempt has been to assign a unique color to each “point” or vertex, and then have the lines connecting
        each pair of vertices (points) be a gradient color transition from one point to the other. This is 
        indeed happening in many cases, however is appears that in some lines the transition is reversed.
        So I will have to iron out this glitch in the algorithm as some point (many points). But I don't 
        actually mind the “noise” that is introduced by the lines with reversed gradients. It adds a kind of color texture.

        LeWitt commonly had other persons follow his simple directions for 
        executing the actual creation of his many wall drawings using pencils or crayon. I and many
        other have experimented with recreating LeWitt’s drawings on the computer by mostly hewing to his simple 
        directions. Some people have also worked out color versions.<a class="href-decor" href="#fn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> My own intention is to next do a version 
        in three-dimensional space. My ethos is to steal like an artist<a class="href-decor" href="#fn1"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, attempting
        to learn something along the way and to experiment with further extensions of the idea.
