      <h2>Sol LeWitt's Algorithmic Drawing (B&W)</h2>
      <p>
        Sol Lewitt was a founder of art movements in the 1960's referred to as minimal and conceptual. 
        Prolific as sculptor, printmaker, and creator of books, he became known also for the large series of 
        drawings made directly on walls of museums and private residences. These drawings were most often
        drawn by various individuals—draftpersons, students, designers, or even museum visitors—according 
        to sets of very simple instructions, such as the one for the drawing visualized on this page:
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>“On a wall surface, any continuous stretch of wall, using a hard pencil, place fifty 
        points at random. The points should be evenly distributed over the area of the wall. All 
        of the points should be connected by straight lines.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        For LeWitt, the work of art was in the conception. The making was secondary. The process of the
        making of the physical artifact could result in a thing of beauty or intellectual interest. But 
        it was not the primary creative act of the art work.
      </p>
      <p>Sol LeWitt did not use the computer. He did not think in terms of algorthims by that name, but rather
        instruction, albeit simple and allowing for latitude of variation in the result.></p>
